## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got very comfortable with using the DOM to manipulate elements using JavaScript. I learned how to get started adding in JavaScript after I finished the HTML and CSS.


### Continued development

I struggled very much with creating transitions for the opening and closing of the answers. I hope to find a workaround for this in the future.
